## <a name="questions"></a> Questions

If you have questions or issues when using this software, please feel free to open an [issue][new-issue] regarding the question. Questions will be addressed as soon as possible.

## <a name="issues"></a> Issues and Bugs

If you encounter any issues or bugs when using this software, please file an [issue][new-issue] for the project. Please ensure, before filing a new issue, that the specific issue or bug discovered has not already been added to the [issues][issues] by another user.

Pull requests to fix bugs are always welcome. If the fix involves a large change to the design of the project, please discuss the proposed change in the issue prior to submitting a pull request. This helps reduce the duplication of work.

## <a name="features"></a> Feature Requests

Feature requests can be submitted by filing an [issue][new-issue] for the project. Please ensure, before filing a new issue, that the specific issue or bug discovered has not already been added to the [issues][issues] by another user.

Pull requests to add new features are generally welcome. However, for new features, it is requested that the design, functionality and purpose of the new feature be described and dicussed on the feature request issue before a pull request for it is submitted. This helps reduce the duplication of work and it ensures that the new feature falls within the project's intended scope.

## <a name="docs"></a> Documentation

Good documentation is the cornerstone of any good open-source software project. Pull requests to improve documentation are always welcome, especially if an aspect of the project is poorly described or not described at all.

Documentation is constantly changing as a project progresses, therefore, it is requested that an [issue][new-issue] be filed before improving the documentation if the change is anticipated to be large in scope.

Smaller changes, such as those that correct grammer and spelling mistakes, can be implemented without the need for a seperate issue to be filed.

### Changelog Maintenance

The `CHANGELOG.md` file describes the changes since the last release (Git tag) was released. This is essential for end users in that it conveys what new features were added, any previously reported bugs that were fixed and if there any breaking changes that need to be addressed in the current release.

The `CHANGELOG.md` file is divided into discrete sections, each describing a discrete release. The contents of these sections are automatically generated since the last release was created.

To generate the latest change information, run the following command in the root of the repository:

    npm install
    node ./scripts/changelog/changelog.js <next-git-tag>

The new features, fixes and any breaking changes will be output to the terminal. Copy the output starting with the `<a name="next-git-tag"></a>` element to the **top** of the `CHANGELOG.md` file. The latest release's changes should always be the top of this file.

**Updates to the `CHANGELOG.md` file should only be performed by project owners during a release cycle.**

## <a name="submissions"></a> Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Reporting issues is a critical component of collaborative software development. Before submitting an issue, please review the already reported [issues][issues] for a duplicate scenario. It is possible that other users have encountered the same issue and recieved a fix or workaround for it.

If the issue appears to be unique, please provide the following information in the issue comment:

* **Overview** - Summary of the issue that is occurring. If an error is being raised (typically in the brower's console), including a non-minified stack trace is appreciated.
* **Motivation or Use Case** - What is your use case? Does your use of this software conform with the current documentation? Are you attempting to operate outside of the documented functionality of the software? This may point to the need for a feature request rather than highlighting an issue with the project source code.
* **Browsers and/or Operating Systems** - When the issue occured, what browser or browers were being used? What is the version of the brower or browers? What is the operating system on which the browser is running? What version is the operating system?
* **Reproduce the Issue** - A reproduction of the issue is very helpful. It is requested that a live example is provided via [Runnable][runnable]. A list of steps to reproduce the issue is also helpful in lieu of a live example. If a list is provided, please be specific as possible so that other contributors can reproduce the issue on their machines.
* **Related Issues** - Has this issue been reported before? Perhaps the issue was reported earlier and was closed prematurely.
* **Suggestions** - If you cannot fix the issue yourself, it is helpful if you can provide any suggestions or implementation ideas so that another contributor can provide a fix more easily. Please be specific as possible.

### Installing the Project Git Pre-Commit Hook Script

A project-wide Git pre-commit hook script has been included in this project's source. Before committing any changes, please install the hook script by entering the following command in the root of the project repository:

     ln -s ../../scripts/git/validate-commit-msg.js .git/hooks/commit-msg

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your pull request, please consider the following guidelines:

* Search the current [pull requests][pull-requests] for an open or closed Pull Request that may be the same or similar to your proposed submission. This helps reduce the duplication of effort.
* Make all your changes in a new branch in your fork:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-change-branch master
     ```

* If not already present, make sure to add your name and e-mail address to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` document.
* Make sure to include all appropriate test cases.
* Make sure to follow the [Code Style Guidelines](#style).
* Run the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass. All merges (pull requests) accepted into the 'master' branch are automatically tested with [drone.io][drone.io].
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows the project [Commit Message Format](#commit-message-format) and passes the project Git pre-commit hook, `validate-commit-msg.js`. Adherence to the [Commit Message Format](#commit-message-format) is required because release notes are automatically generated from commit messages.

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```
  Please note that the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

* Push your branch to your fork:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-change-branch
    ```

* Send a pull request to `katex.dart:master`.
* If changes are needed or requested in response to the Pull Request, please perform the following: 
  * Make the required or requested changes to the branch in your fork.
  * Run the project test suite to ensure tests are still passing.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your forked repository (this will update the Pull Request).

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

  * Remove (squash) any intermediate commits so that the commit history is kept clean. See [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15055649) on Stack Overflow for information on how to do this.

#### Pull Request Post-Acceptance Tasks

After your Pull Request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the upstream repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub website or your local terminal as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-change-branch
    ```

* Checkout the "master" branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

* Delete your local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-change-branch
    ```

* Update your local "master" branch with the latest upstream changes:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

## <a name="style"></a> Code Style Guidelines

To ensure consistency throughout the project source code, it is requested that the following guidelines be considered when contributing to this project:

  * All new features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more [specs][unit-testing]. See the [Testing](#testing) section below.
  * All public API methods **must be documented** with [doc comments][doc-comments].
  * Besides any of the specific exceptions noted below, this project attempts to conform with the style rules described in
  [Google's Dart Style Guide][dart-style-guide].

## <a name="testing"></a> Testing

As outlined above, all changes must be submitted with an appropriate amount of unit tests.

In pursuit of this requirement, a Gruntfile has been included with this project so that tests can be run easily and automatically when either the source or test files change.

Due to the fact that libraries in this project depend on the `dart:html` package, tests cannot be executed with the standalone Dart VM, and therefore, Karma must used as the test runner.

To start the Karma server in the background and to begin listening to changes in both the `lib` and `test` directories, run the following commands in the root of the repository:

    npm install
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    grunt

When a change occurs, the results of the testing process should be displayed in the console.

To run the tests without keeping the Karma server running (single-run mode), run the following command in the root of the repository:

    make test

This command will start the Karma server, open Dartium, execute the unit tests, close Dartium and kill the Karma server.

If the command fails with the following error:

    ERROR [launcher]: No binary for Dartium browser on your platform.

Please set the `DARTIUM_BIN` environment variable in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file. For example, on OS X, this may appear similar to the following:

    export DARTIUM_BIN=~/dev/dart/chromium/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium

Where `/dev/dart` may depend on where your installation of the Dart SDK is on your system.

## <a name="benchmarking"></a> Benchmarking

During or after a major code refactoring, it is encouraged to run a performance benchmark before and after the said modifications.

To run the benchmark harness, run the following command from the repository root of the project:

    make benchmark

After the command completes, visit the following address in a web browser of choice:

    http://localhost:8080

The benchmark code will be executed 10 times and the resulting "time per execution" will display in the browser console (in microseconds).

Please note that only the Dartium web browser that ships with the Dart SDK can run the benchmark harness.

## <a name="commits"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

Please review the guidelines and rules described below when creating commit messages.

These guidelines help to keep the project commit history readable. In addition, the project release notes (changelogs) are automatically generated from the commit messages that have occurred between discrete tags, so consistently formatted messages help users decipher changes when updating their package versions.

### <a name="commit-message-format"></a> Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.

The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message **cannot** be longer 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier to review through the GitHub interface, as well as, in Git command line tools.

### Type

The "type" field must be one of the following:

* **feat**: New features.
* **fix**: Bug fixes.
* **docs**: Documentation changes.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the semantics of the code or the design intent (white space, formatting, missing semi-colons...etc.). Changes which are purely visual or aesthetic in nature to demos and examples are also included under this type.
* **refactor**: Changes that neither fix a bug or add a feature.
* **perf**: A code change that improves runtime performance.
* **test**: Adds missing tests.
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or to auxiliary tools and libraries. For example, changes to tools which handle automated documentation generation are covered under this commit type.

### Scope

The scope can be anything specifying the location of the change. Examples can include:

* Class names
* Library names
* File names (without the file extension)
* Major function names

The goal of the scope is to help other contributors quickly locate a commit message of interest that impacts a specific system or subsystem of the project.

### Subject

The subject contains a brief (but detailed) description of the change. Please consider the following when entering a subject:

* Use the imperative, present tense forms - "change" instead of "changed" or "changes".
* Do not capitalize the first letter.
* Do not include a period or dot (.) at the end.

###Body

As in the **subject** field, use the imperative, present tense forms - "change" instead of "changed" or "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and its contrast with previous behavior.

###Footer

The footer should contain information about any breaking changes. The footer should also reference any GitHub issues that this commit closes, if applicable. To associate a specific commit activity with the closing of a GitHub issue, please see [this](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages) page.
